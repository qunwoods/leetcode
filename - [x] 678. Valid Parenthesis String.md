- [x] 678. Valid Parenthesis String

日期：2017-11-12

描述：给定一个字符串，字符串中只包含( 、* 和 )，其中 * 可以表示空白、( 或 )；判断这样的一个序列是否为有效的括号序列

思路：只需要顺序遍历一次以及逆序遍历一次，分别判断一侧括号数量是否小于等于*加另一侧括号的数量即可

代码：

```Python
class Solution:
    def order(self, s):
        # 顺序判断，如果当前)出现的次数少于(和*出现的次数之和
        # 则False

        diff = star = 0

        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                diff += 1
            elif char == ')':
                diff -= 1
                if diff < 0:
                    diff += star
                    star = 0
                    if diff < 0:
                        return False
            elif char == '*':
                star += 1
        if diff < 0:
            if diff + star < 0:
                return False
        return True

    def reversed_order(self, s):
        # 逆序判断，如果当前(出现的次数少于)和*出现的次数之和
        # 则False

        diff = star = 0

        for char in s:
            if char == ')':
                diff += 1
            elif char == '(':
                diff -= 1
                if diff < 0:
                    diff += star
                    star = 0
                    if diff < 0:
                        return False
            elif char == '*':
                star += 1
        if diff < 0:
            if diff - star < 0:
                return False
        return True

    def checkValidString(self, s):
        # 统计( * )出现的次数，然后搜索
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return self.order(s) and self.reversed_order(reversed(s))
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def check(self, s, first, last):
        diff = star = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == first:
                diff += 1
            elif char == last:
                diff -= 1
                if diff < 0:
                    diff += star
                    star = 0
                    if diff < 0:
                        return False
            elif char == '*':
                star += 1
            else:
                pass
        if diff < 0:
            if diff + star < 0:
                return False
        else:
            return True
    
    def checkValidString(self, s):
        return self.check(s, '(', ')') and (self.check(reversed(s), ')', '('))
